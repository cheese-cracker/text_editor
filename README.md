This is a simple Text Editor which you can use for small things.
The TEXT BOX ENTRY is where you have the option of typing the line number where you want to INSERT FILE or DELETE LINE (or else default vaues will be used).
The aim of this branch is to isolate the text box and command box into two classes.
Thanks, CH.
